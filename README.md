# twitter-analytics

As part of group project in the class "DATA ANALYTICS" at Columbia University, we chose to analyse the main subjects and opinions of the main presidential candidates through their Twitter accounts.

We created a web application using Flask with analysis of key measures such as the sentiments of the candidates, their objectivity level and the polarity ratio. Another aim of this analysis is to evaluate the strategy of each candidate and important politician during the campaign.

We used the Twitter API (Tweepy) to collect the tweets and useful python librairies such as PyEnchant, TextBlob, WordCloud and nltk.
